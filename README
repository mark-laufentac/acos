----- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -----
acos is just another unix-inspired OS; it'll probably never be usable but hey...
it's fun

goals (just to have something to aim for):
readability
configurability
stability
brevity when not sacrificing readability

there may be better goals to aim for depending on use case, but these best
encapsulate the code I like using/reading

I plan to use Common Lisp or Haskell for higher-level programs where possible
(maybe for some of the application suite?) for educational purposes


----- BORING INFO -----
development updates will be posted on <marklauf yt>

docs can be found as ascii diagrams throughout the codebase or under the man dir

acos is under the 2-clause BSD license (see LICENSE)

FreeBSD code styling is followed with some very slight modifications (see STYLE)


----- COLLABORATION -----
I don't want to make a code-of-conduct as that seems sorta authoritative,
especially for an open-source BSD-licensed project. The only thing I'll say is
to respect people's boundaries. If you think someone is a 'snowflake' who can't
take jokes, for example, don't bring that into the project; just collaborate
with people who are comfortable with those jokes and don't make the more fragile
feel bad (and vice-versa).

that aside, all pull reqs are welcome!
email me any time at aarocerr@gmail.com for acos questions, recommendations,
rants, or anything you please

I hope to foster a community even though it's unlikely :) (pls I'm very lonely)
